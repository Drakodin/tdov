## What does TDOV mean?
Trans Day of Visibility!

### What is this?
It will look like a blank site for every day except TDOV (March 31). On TDOV, it will change into its active variant with words of encouragement, links to resources, and other useful and/or cheerful things.

### Can't Wait? Activate it yourself!
It's possible to see all of this w/o it being TDOV by calling the child function with a date that refers to March 31. It does consume UNIX timestamps so do note this.
