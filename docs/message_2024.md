### Stand Strong
*This is the script for the 2024 message on the live site. Audio clips will be found in the repository under media/audio/2024*

This year has been rough.

Let's get back to the basics.

Trans rights are human rights.

Everyone is valid and there's no need to feel alone.

We stand united, together we make progress.

Be joyous, be free.

Rise up, from the ruins, from dystopia.

And raise your colors.

Stand strong and no one can take you down.

Happy Trans Day of Visibility.
